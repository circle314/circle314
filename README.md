Circle314 Framework

## <span style="color:#ff0000">Warning! This framework is in alpha stage!</span>

While a lot of effort has gone into make the framework compliant in terms of code accuracy, robustness, adherence
to SOLID principles, and adherence to various PHP PSRs, it is still very much in alpha phase.

Recent changes made to the framework have "broken" functionality in projects it has been used in, and there are still
quite a few changes to be made to interfaces of near-complete modules.

Also, some modules are slated for removal or entire revamp, including:

 - FileLocator (revamp)
 - IO (future removal)
 - RenderableObject (revamp)
 - Rendering (revamp)
 - Session (future removal)
 
Modules that are safe to use at the moment include

 - Collection
 - Constant
 - Concept
 - Data
 - Encoding
 - Encryption
 - ErrorHandling
 - ExceptionHandling
 - Hash
 - ShutdownHandler
 - Type

If you wish to use this library, feel free to, it's publicly available for a reason. The documentation is currently quote
lacking, but only because the guts of the code base are still under work. I am happy to explain how to best utilise this
framework to anyone who's interested in using it. If you have any questions please contact me via kjartan-at-artofwar-dot-cc.

Kind Regards,

Kjartan Johansen
