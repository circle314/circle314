Circle314 Framework

## <span style="color:#ff0000">Warning! This framework is in alpha stage!</span>

While a lot of effort has gone into make the framework compliant in terms of code accuracy, robustness, adherence to SOLID principles, and adherence to various PHP PSRs, it is still very much in alpha phase.

Recent changes made to the framework have "broken" functionality in projects it has been used in, and there are still quite a few changes to be made to interfaces of near-complete modules.

Also, some modules are slated for removal or entire revamp, including Rendering, Authentication, FileLocation, IO, ParameterSet, and Session.

Modules thatare safe(-ish) to use at the moment include Collection, Concept, Data, Encoding, Encryption, ErrorHandling, ExceptionHandling, Hash, Modelling, Schema, and Type.

Note that there is a strong possibility that some of these safe(-ish) modules will be refactored into different namespaces in the near future. A good example of this is Schema, which should reside under Modelling, and Modelling, which should probably reside under Data.

If you wish to use this library, feel free to, it's publicly available for a reason. If you have any questions please contact me via kjartan-at-artofwar-dot-cc, I'm happy to explain the purpose of the library, and how to best utilise it.

Kind Regards,

Kjartan Johansen
